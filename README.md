# snowModelingCode
This repository contains code that will be useful in understanding parameters important to snow metamorphism.

In particular, one purpose for this repository will be to develop physical models for the processes that impact post-depositional modification of isotopes in near-surface snow.

Another purpose for the code in this repository will be to develop physical models for the processes that impact heat transfer in near-surface snow.
